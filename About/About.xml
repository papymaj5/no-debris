- This is a reupload of an existing mod, updated to a new version.
- I did not make this mod and claim no ownership of it.
- If the original author wishes, I will remove this mod.
- The original author may feel free to use this version to update their mod.
- Once the original is updated, I will discontinue this version.

Make sure to disable the original mod!  

Finally the game is playable again!

This mod prevents the drawing the debris (scatter) entirely, on all terrain. Blood, dirt, rubble, etc. will still be drawn, but the terrain will look smoother.
